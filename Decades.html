The following year, once again at the Peninsula, a female assistant said Mr. Weinstein badgered her into giving him a massage while he was naked, leaving her “crying and very distraught,” wrote a colleague, Lauren O’Connor, in a searing memo asserting sexual harassment and other misconduct by their boss.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="165" data-total-count="1265">“There is a toxic environment for women at this company,” Ms. O’Connor said in the letter, addressed to several executives at the company run by Mr. Weinstein.</p><div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

Ms. Nestor, who declined to comment for this article, refused his bargain, the records noted. “She was disappointed that he met with her and did not seem to be interested in her résumé or skill set.” The young woman chose not to report the episode to human resources personnel, but the allegations came to management’s attention through other employees.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="552" data-total-count="9096">Across the years and continents, accounts of Mr. Weinstein’s conduct share a common narrative: Women reported to a hotel for what they thought were work reasons, only to discover that Mr. Weinstein, who has been married for most of three decades, sometimes seemed to have different interests. His home base was New York, but his rolling headquarters were luxury hotels: the Peninsula Beverly Hills and the Savoy in London, the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc near the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/arts/cannes-film-festival-2017-celebrating-the-old-and-the-new.html">Cannes</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/arts/cannes-film-festival-2017-celebrating-the-old-and-the-new.html"> Film Festival</a> in France and the Stein Eriksen Lodge near the Sundance Film Festival.</p><figure id="media-100000005479555" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005479555 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/05/us/00Inquiry4/00Inquiry4-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="278" data-total-count="9374">Working for Mr. Weinstein could mean getting him out of bed in the morning and doing “turndown duty” late at night, preparing him for sleep. Like the colleague cited in Ms. O’Connor’s memo, some junior employees required to perform those tasks said they were disturbing.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="549" data-total-count="9923">In interviews, eight women described varying behavior by Mr. Weinstein: appearing nearly or fully naked in front of them, requiring them to be present while he bathed or repeatedly asking for a massage or initiating one himself. The women, typically in their early or middle 20s and hoping to get a toehold in the film industry, said he could switch course quickly — meetings and clipboards one moment, intimate comments the next. One woman advised a peer to wear a parka when summoned for duty as a layer of protection against unwelcome advances.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="331" data-total-count="10254">Laura Madden, a former employee who said Mr. Weinstein prodded her for massages at hotels in Dublin and London beginning in 1991, said he had a way of making anyone who objected feel like an outlier. “It was so manipulative,” she said in an interview. “You constantly question yourself — am I the one who is the problem?”</p><div id="story-ad-4" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

They range in age from early 20s to late 40s and live in different cities. Some said they did not report the behavior because there were no witnesses and they feared retaliation by Mr. Weinstein. Others said they felt embarrassed. But most confided in co-workers.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="362" data-total-count="11047">Ms. Madden later told Karen Katz, a friend and colleague in the acquisitions department, about Mr. Weinstein’s overtures, including a time she locked herself in the bathroom of his hotel room, sobbing. “We were so young at the time,” said Ms. Katz, now a documentary filmmaker. “We did not understand how wrong it was or how Laura should deal with it.”</p><div class="newsletter-signup hidden auto-newsletter variant-1-hidden " id="newsletter-promo" data-newsletter-productCode="" data-newsletter-productTitle="" aria-labeledby="newsletter-promo-heading">

Some described long and satisfying careers with him, praising him as a mentor and advocate.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="299" data-total-count="12197">But in interviews, some of the former employees who said they had troubling experiences with Mr. Weinstein asked a common question: How could allegations repeating the same pattern — young women, a powerful male producer, even some of the same hotels — have accumulated for almost three decades?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="292" data-total-count="12489">“It wasn’t a secret to the inner circle,” said Kathy DeClesis, Bob Weinstein’s assistant in the early 1990s.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="414" data-total-count="12903">Speaking up could have been costly. A job with Mr. Weinstein was a privileged perch at the nexus of money, fame and art, and plenty of his former assistants have risen high in Hollywood. He could be charming and generous: gift baskets, flowers, personal or career help and cash. At the Cannes Film Festival, according to several former colleagues, he sometimes handed out thousands of dollars as impromptu bonuses.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="549" data-total-count="13452">Mr. Weinstein was a volcanic personality, though, given to fits of rage and personal lashings of male and female employees alike. When a female guest of his had to wait for a hotel room upgrade, he yelled that Ms. O’Connor would be better off marrying a “fat, rich Jewish” man because she was probably just good for “being a wife” and “making babies,” she wrote in her memo. (He added some expletives, she said.) His treatment of women was sometimes written off as just another form of toxicity, according to multiple former employees.</p><div id="story-ad-5" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="492" data-total-count="13944" id="story-continues-7">In the fall of 1998, a 25-year-old London assistant named Zelda Perkins confronted Mr. Weinstein. According to former colleagues, she and several co-workers had been regularly subjected to inappropriate requests or comments in hotel rooms, and she was particularly concerned about the treatment of another woman in the office. She told Mr. Weinstein that he had to stop, according to the former colleagues, and that she would go public or initiate legal action unless he changed his behavior.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="182" data-total-count="14126">Steve Hutensky, one of Miramax’s entertainment lawyers, was dispatched to London to negotiate a settlement with Ms. Perkins and her lawyer. He declined to comment for this article.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="191" data-total-count="14317">Ms. Perkins, now a theater producer in London, also declined to comment for this article, saying that she could not discuss her work at Miramax or whether she had entered into any agreements.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="319" data-total-count="14636">Months after the settlement, Mr. Weinstein triumphed at the Oscars, with “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9905EFDF113DF930A15753C1A96E958260">Life I</a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9905EFDF113DF930A15753C1A96E958260">s Beautiful</a>” and “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B05E4D9103AF932A25751C1A96E958260">Shakespeare in Love</a>” winning 10 awards. A few years later, Mr. Weinstein, who had produced a series of British-themed movies, was made a Commander of the British Empire, an honorary title just short of knighthood.</p><h4 class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="25" data-total-count="14661">‘Coercive Bargaining’</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="506" data-total-count="15167">For actors, a meeting with Mr. Weinstein could yield dazzling rewards: scripts, parts, award campaigns, magazine coverage, influence on lucrative endorsement deals. He knew how to blast small films to box office success, and deliver polished dramas like “The King’s Speech” and popular attractions like the “Scary Movie” franchise. Mr. Weinstein’s films helped define femininity, sex and romance, from Catherine Zeta-Jones in “Chicago” to Jennifer Lawrence in “Silver Linings Playbook.”</p><figure id="media-100000005479541" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005479541 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/04/us/00inquiry2/00inquiry2-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="416" data-total-count="15583">But movies were also his private leverage. When Mr. Weinstein invited Ms. Judd to breakfast in Beverly Hills, she had been shooting the thriller “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0CE2DA173DF930A35753C1A961958260">Kiss the Girls</a>” all night, but the meeting seemed too important to miss.

Could he give her a massage? When she refused, he suggested a shoulder rub. She rejected that too, she recalled. He steered her toward a closet, asking her to help pick out his clothing for the day, and then toward the bathroom. Would she watch him take a shower? she remembered him saying.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="171" data-total-count="16109">“I said no, a lot of ways, a lot of times, and he always came back at me with some new ask,” Ms. Judd said. “It was all this bargaining, this coercive bargaining.”</p><div id="story-ad-6" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

She recalled feeling “panicky, trapped,” she said in the interview. “There’s a lot on the line, the cachet that came with Miramax.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="342" data-total-count="16740">Not long afterward, she related what had happened to her mother, the singer Naomi Judd, who confirmed their conversation to a Times reporter. Years later, Ashley Judd appeared in two Weinstein films without incident, she said. In 2015, she shared an account of the episode in the hotel room with “<a href="http://variety.com/2015/film/news/ashley-judd-sexual-harassment-studio-mogul-shower-1201610666/">Variety</a>” without naming the man involved.</p><figure id="media-100000005476312" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005476312" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/04/us/00Inquiry3/00Inquiry3-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

The $100,000 settlement was “not to be construed as an admission” by Mr. Weinstein, but intended to “avoid litigation and buy peace,” according to the legal document, which was reviewed by The Times. <a href="http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/07/07/rose-mcgowan-condemns-hollywood-for-harassment-and-abuse-of-actresses/">Ms. McGowan</a> had just appeared in the slasher film “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F0CEEDE1431F933A15751C1A960958260">Scream</a>” and would later star in the television show “Charmed.” She declined to comment.</p><figure id="news-tips-article-promo" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-small">

The woman, who asked not to be identified to protect her privacy, said a nondisclosure agreement prevented her from commenting.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="99" data-total-count="17753">Soon, complaints about Mr. Weinstein’s behavior prompted the board of his company to take notice.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="352" data-total-count="18105">In March 2015, Mr. Weinstein had invited Ambra Battilana, an Italian model and aspiring actress, to his TriBeCa office on a Friday evening to discuss her career. Within hours, she called the police. Ms. Battilana told them that Mr. Weinstein had grabbed her breasts after asking if they were real and put his hands up her skirt, the police report says.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="319" data-total-count="18424">The claims were taken up by the New York Police Department’s Special Victims Squad and splashed across the pages of tabloids, along with reports that the woman had worked with investigators to secretly record a confession from Mr. Weinstein. The Manhattan district attorney’s office later declined to bring charges.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="173" data-total-count="18597">But Mr. Weinstein made a payment to Ms. Battilana, according to people familiar with the settlement, speaking on the condition of anonymity about the confidential agreement.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="308" data-total-count="18905">The public nature of the episode concerned some executives and board members of the Weinstein Company. (Harvey and Bob Weinstein together own 42 percent of the privately held business.) When several board members pressed Mr. Weinstein about it, he insisted that the woman had set him up, colleagues recalled.</p><div id="story-ad-7" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

</div>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="465" data-total-count="19370" id="story-continues-9">Ms. Battilana had testified in court proceedings against associates of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy who are accused of procuring women for alleged sex parties, and the Italian news media also reported that, years ago Ms. Battilana accused a septuagenarian boyfriend of sexual harassment, a complaint that was apparently dismissed. Ms. Battilana did not respond to requests for comment. Her lawyer, Mauro Rufini, could not be reached for comment.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="172" data-total-count="19542">After the episode, Lance Maerov, a board member, said he successfully pushed for a code of behavior for the company that included detailed language about sexual harassment.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="223" data-total-count="19765">Then Ms. O’Connor’s memo hit, with page after page of detailed accusations. In describing the experiences of women at the company, including her own, she wrote, “The balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="354" data-total-count="20119">She was a valued employee — Mr. Weinstein described her as “fantastic,” “a great person,” “a brilliant executive” — so the complaint rattled top executives, including Bob Weinstein. When the board was notified of it by email, Mr. Maerov insisted that an outside lawyer determine whether the allegations were true, he said in an interview.</p><figure id="media-100000005479562" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005479562 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/05/us/00Inquiry7/00Inquiry7-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">
